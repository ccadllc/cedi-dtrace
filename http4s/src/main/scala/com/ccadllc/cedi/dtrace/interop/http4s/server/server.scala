   * This function can be used to execute a traced action within an `HttpService[F]` with
   * the [[TraceContext]] of `F` possibly derived from HTTP headers, given instances of `cats.effect.Sync[F]`, [[HeaderCodec]],
   * and [[TraceSystem]] of `F` in implicit scope. The [[HeaderCodec]] is usually imported from either
   * `com.ccadllc.cedi.dtrace.money._`, or `com.ccadllc.cedi.dtrace.xb3._` for Money or X-B3 trace headers, respectively.
   * You can also provide your own [[HeaderCodec]] if, for instance, you wish to compose these into an aggregate
   * or there are other types of trace headers you wish to extract.  This function also requires that you
   * provide the initial `Span.Name` along with any [[Note]]s you wish to include in the initial [[Span]], both dependent
   * on the particular action.
