  /**
   * This function can be used to execute a traced action within an `HttpService[F]` with
   * the [[TraceContext]] of `F` possibly derived from HTTP headers, given instances of `cats.effect.Sync[F]`, [[HeaderCodec]],
   * and [[TraceSystem]] of `F` in implicit scope. The [[HeaderCodec]] is usually imported from either
   * `com.ccadllc.cedi.dtrace.money._`, or `com.ccadllc.cedi.dtrace.xb3._` for Money or X-B3 trace headers, respectively.
   * You can also provide your own [[HeaderCodec]] if, for instance, you wish to compose these into an aggregate
   * or there are other types of trace headers you wish to extract. For example, this will result
   * in both `Money` and `XB3` HTTP Headers being considered for extraction into a `SpanId`, with `XB3` headers
   * first considered (reverse it or use `compose` rather than `andThen` to have the `Money` headers prioritized):
   *    ```implicit val myHeaderCodec: HeaderCodec = com.ccadllc.cedi.dtrace.interop.xb3.headerCodec.andThen(
   *      com.ccadllc.cedi.dtrace.interop.money.headerCodec
   *    )```
   * This function also requires that you provide the initial `Span.Name` along with an `Evaluator[A]` to
   * determine if an application-specific result should be considered a span failure - use [[tracedAction]] if
   * you have no need to pass in an `Evaluator` - along with any [[Note]]s you wish to include in the spans.
