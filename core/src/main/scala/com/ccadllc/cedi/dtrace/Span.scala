 * @param spanName - the human readable name of this span - it is the logical name of the effectful program whose execution

 * @param startTime - the `java.time.Instant` representing the timestamp at which the program started execution
 * @param failure - the [[FailureDetail]] is present and provides a means to render the detail of a program execution failure
 *   if the execution failed; otherwise is it not present.
 * @param duration - the elapsed time of the execution of the program.
 * @param notes - a `Vector` of [[Note]]s used to annotate the program's execution with metadata, which can be derived both from
 *   the program's inputs as well as its results.
